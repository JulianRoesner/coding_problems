# Practicing coding problems
These are my solutions to some of the 100 coding interview questions listed [here](https://codeburst.io/100-coding-interview-questions-for-programmers-b1cf74885fb7). The solutions are implemented in Swift.

## Run the tests
You can run each individual file with this command:
```bash
swift <filename>
```

If you want to run all the tests with all the files, just use the bash script
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```
